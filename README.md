Multi-threaded Ray Tracing API in C++

Fairly based on the wonderful [book series](https://raytracing.github.io) on ray tracing.

This is under active development; adding left over functionality from the series (BVH, jitter sampling, emissive objects, scattering to name a few standard techniques left).

Also, in the near future, I plan to make the whole setup available as a small 3D image manipulation language with bison/javacc to make it usable more generally.
